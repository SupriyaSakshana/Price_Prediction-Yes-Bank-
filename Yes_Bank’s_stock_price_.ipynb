        "The main objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the monthly closing price of Yes Bank stock, while considering the impact of the fraud case that occurred in 2018.\n",
        "\n",
        "To achieve this, three models were developed and evaluated: Ridge Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost Regressor. Among these, the XGBoost Regressor demonstrated the best performance, achieving an R² score of approximately 0.97 on both the training and testing datasets. This indicates strong predictive capability and good generalization. Additionally, the model effectively handles multicollinearity and incorporates all newly engineered features.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data visualization of the target variable clearly highlights the significant impact of the 2018 fraud case involving Rana Kapoor, during which the stock prices declined sharply. This confirms that major financial events strongly influence stock price movements.\n",
        "\n",
        "Further analysis revealed that most variables in the dataset were positively skewed. To address this issue and improve model performance, log transformation was applied to normalize the distributions.\n",
        "\n",
        "For feature engineering, the mean of the Open, High, and Low prices was calculated to form a new feature (OHL). In addition, multiple lag features were created to capture temporal trends and historical patterns. These lag features also help the model understand abnormal behavior during periods such as the fraud case.\n",
        "\n",
        "The most important features contributing to the prediction of the closing price were identified as:\n",
        "OHL, lag1, lag2, lag4, lag6, lag9, lag11, and lag12.\n",
        "\n",
        "One limitation of the dataset is that it contains only monthly stock prices. Using daily-level data could improve prediction accuracy by allowing the model to analyze short-term patterns such as weekly trends and weekend effects. Furthermore, including trading volume and external factors such as political events, economic policies, holidays, and unforeseen disasters could enhance model performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Stock price prediction is influenced by many complex and dynamic factors. Therefore, incorporating additional features and applying advanced time-series models such as ARIMA and LSTM may lead to more accurate and robust predictions in the future.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, given the available dataset and engineered features, the developed XGBoost model performs well across all data points. With its high predictive accuracy and strong generalization capability, the model can be confidently deployed for future stock price forecasting tasks."
